Angular?

Angular is a front-end FrameWork and a developer-platform developed by Google in 2012. Angular is built upon TS unlike it's previous version Angular Js which is based on JS. We also called this as Angular+/Angular2

use: SPA(Single Page Application) and PWA(Progressive Web Apps)

FrameWorks vs Libraries:
Library is a predefined code for specific purpose, React is also a library for UI purpose

but frameWorks provide complete developer needs as a package 

Step 1: install npm and check the version by npm -v
srep 2: npm install -g @angular/cli and check the version by "ng v"

scaffolding means a separate terminal commands generates a basic code.

Folder Structure Analysis
tsconfig files defines rules typescript compiler follows when converting ts into Js
tsconfig.spect.json--->testing
tsconfig.app--->application
tsconfig.json--->Whole project
readme.md-->instruction file
package.json--> it describes the meta data of project
package-lock.json--> it describes meta data of package.json
.gitignore ----> it contains files which can be ignored while git stores in github
angular.json---> ruleset for angular
.editorconfig---> defines ruleset for editor 

converting Static DOM into Dynamic DOM is called Bootstrapping

Whole application will be divided as components. each component will have .ts(component file), .spec.ts(testing),.html(template file), .css(styling), all component will have a name(selector), all components are mentioned in Module

app>index.html---> main html file which contains app-root
main.ts---> which bootstraps app Module
style.css---> main.css file
