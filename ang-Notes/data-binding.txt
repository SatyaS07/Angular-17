Data bindig:
The transmission of Data from component to template or Template to Component or both
Angular supports one way and two way data binding
i. one way data binding:
  a. Component to Template:
    1. string interpolation: it is a way of getting data from component to template as a string
    we will do it by {{}}(double flower brackets)
    2.property Binding:
    it is also another way of sending data from component to template but it won't data as string.
    we will do it using square brackets []
  b. from template to component 
    this is called Event Binding. It is used to send data from template to component
    we will achieve this by paranthesis '()'

    Two-Way Data Binging :
     Two way data binding means data should be sent from component to template and template to component at a time

     We will achieve two way data binding by ngModal with like this "[(ngModal)]

     steps:
     syntax:<input [(ngModel)] = "variable">, u will write variable in ts file(component file).
     To make ngModal work, import FormsModule in app.module.ts and write it in its imports
